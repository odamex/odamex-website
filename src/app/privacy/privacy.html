Odamex will not share personally identifiable information with other parties except as described in this policy. Odamex may also collect aggregate information and individual information. "Aggregate information" is information that describes the habits, usage patterns, and demographics of users as a group but does not describe or reveal the identity of any particular user. "Individual information" is information about a user or user&rsquo;s machine that is presented in a form distinguishable from information relating to other users but not in a form that personally identifies any user or enables the recipient to communicate directly with any user. Odamex may share aggregate and individual information with other parties without restriction.
